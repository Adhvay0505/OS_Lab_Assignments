## 📘 **Overview**
This repository contains **four Operating Systems lab assignments** completed as part of the 5th-semester curriculum.  
Each assignment demonstrates the implementation of core OS concepts through practical programming in **Python & some Bash** on a **Linux environment**.

## 🧩 **Assignment 1 — Process Management in Linux**
**Objective:** Understand process creation, execution, and management using Linux system calls.

### **Included Tasks**
- **Creating and Managing Processes:** Using `fork()` to create multiple child processes.  
- **Executing External Commands:** Using `exec()` to run commands like `ls -l`.  
- **Special Process States:** Demonstrating **Zombie** and **Orphan** processes.  
- **Process Information Access:** Reading process details from the `/proc` filesystem.  
- **Process Priority Management:** Adjusting CPU scheduling priority using the `nice` command.

### **📄 Files Included**
- `process_management.py`  
- `output.txt`    
- `report.pdf`

## 💾 **Assignment 4 — Batch Processing, System Simulation & IPC**
**Objective:** Simulate batch execution, system startup behavior, IPC mechanisms, VM detection, and extended CPU scheduling.

### **Included Tasks**
- **Task 1 — Batch Processing Simulation (Python)**  
  Execute multiple Python scripts sequentially using `subprocess`.
- **Task 2 — System Startup & Logging**  
  Simulate a mini system boot sequence using `multiprocessing` and logging.
- **Task 3 — System Calls & IPC**  
  Implement `fork`, `exec`, and **pipes** for inter-process communication.
- **Task 4 — VM Detection & Shell Interaction**  
  Use a **shell script** to show system details and a Python script to detect virtualization.
- **Task 5 — CPU Scheduling Algorithms (Extended)**  
  Implement: **FCFS**, **SJF**, **Round Robin**, **Priority Scheduling**.

### **📄 Files Included**
